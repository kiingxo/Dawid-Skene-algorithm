Summary of changes:

The code was improved by addressing the FutureWarning regarding the use of `int()` on a pandas Series.  The inefficient access to the 'label' column within the inner loop was also improved, and added comments to improve readability.  The main loop was also renamed to `iteration` for better clarity.  These changes enhance the code's efficiency, readability, and future compatibility.
